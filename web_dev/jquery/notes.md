Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

# Spend 30 min on finding out the following and take notes:
## What is jQuery?
* The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
* jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
* jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
* jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

* There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:
  * Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com
  * Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google
* The jQuery library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML <script> tag (notice that the <script> tag should be inside the <head> section):

```HTML
<head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head>
```

## How does jQuery work with HTML and web?
* add it to any HTML page
## Scripting language?
* A scripting language is a language that "scripts" other things to do stuff. The primary focus isn't primarily building your own apps so much as getting an existing app to act the way you want, e.g. JavaScript for browsers

## What can jQuery do?
* The jQuery library contains the following features:

  * HTML/DOM manipulation
  * CSS manipulation
  * HTML event methods
  * Effects and animations

  * Utilities
